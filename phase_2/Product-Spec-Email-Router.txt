- Identifies and mitigates risks

### Development Engineer

- Manages technical architecture
- Evaluates technical feasibility
- Identifies and resolves technical challenges

## Routing Rules

### Route to Product Manager when:
- The email discusses product vision or strategy

- The email requests status updates on project milestones
- The inquiry is about risk management or mitigation strategies
- The message concerns cross-team collaboration or communication

### Route to Development Engineer when:
- The email discusses technical implementation details
- The inquiry is about code-level issues or bugs
- The message concerns system architecture or design
- The email requests information about technical feasibility
- The inquiry is about performance optimization or technical debt
- The message discusses API specifications or integration details

## Examples

### Product Manager Examples:
- "We need to prioritize the social sharing feature for the next release."
- "Can we analyze how our pricing compares to Competitor X's new offering?"
- "The customer feedback suggests we should reconsider the dashboard layout."

### Program Manager Examples:
- "When can we expect the payment integration to be completed?"
- "We need to coordinate with the marketing team for the launch."
- "What's the status of the Q3 deliverables?"

### Development Engineer Examples:
- "The authentication service is returning 500 errors intermittently."
- "How should we implement the caching layer for the product catalog?"
- "Can we optimize the database queries for the reporting feature?"

## Handling Ambiguous Requests
If a request could be handled by multiple roles, consider:
1. The primary focus of the request (strategic, operational, or technical)
2. The expertise required to provide the most valuable response
3. The expected outcome or deliverable from the request

When truly ambiguous, route to the Product Manager who can then delegate as appropriate.
