PROMPT:
Evaluate this response to 'Explain how neural networks work in simple terms.':

Neural networks are like brains and they learn stuff.

RESPONSE:
{
  "final_response": "Improved Response:\nNeural networks are a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes organized in layers. These networks process data by taking input, applying weights to these inputs, and passing them through activation functions to produce an output. During training, neural networks adjust these weights based on errors in predictions, a process known as backpropagation. This iterative learning process allows neural networks to make predictions or classifications based on the patterns in the data they have been trained on.",
