PROMPT:
Explain the concept of blockchain.

RESPONSE:
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across a network of computers. It enables secure and transparent peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. Each transaction is recorded in a block, which is linked to the previous block in a chronological order, forming a chain of blocks. This chain is maintained by multiple participants (nodes) in the network, ensuring that no single entity controls the data. Blockchain technology is known for its security, immutability, transparency, and potential applications in various industries beyond cryptocurrencies, such as supply chain management, healthcare, voting systems, and more.
