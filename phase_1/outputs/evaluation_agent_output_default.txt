PROMPT:
Evaluate this response to 'Explain how neural networks work in simple terms.' with default criteria:


    Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) 
    organized in layers. Each connection has a weight that adjusts as the network learns.

    The process works like this:
    1. Input data enters through the input layer
    2. It's processed through hidden layers where each neuron applies a mathematical function
    3. The output layer produces the final result

    Neural networks learn by adjusting connection weights based on the difference between predicted and actual outputs,
    a process called backpropagation. This allows them to recognize patterns and make predictions without explicit programming.

  "final_response": "Improved Response:\n\nNeural networks are computational models inspired by the structure of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, where each connection between neurons has a weight associated with it. These weights are adjusted as the network learns from data.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation of how neural networks work:\n\n1. **Input Layer**: The input data is fed into the neural network through the input layer. Each node in this layer represents a feature of the input data.\n\n2. **Hidden Layers**: The input data is then processed through one or more hidden layers. In each hidden layer, each neuron applies an activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs. This introduces non-linearities into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data. Common activation functions include the sigmoid function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and tanh function.\n\n3. **Output Layer**: After passing through the hidden layers, the processed data reaches the output layer, where the final result or prediction is produced. The number of nodes in the output layer depends on the type of task the neural network is designed for (e.g., classification, regression).\n\n4. **Training Process**: Neural networks learn by adjusting the weights of connections based on the error between the predicted output and the actual output. This process involves two main steps:\n   - **Forward Propagation**: The input data is fed forward through the network, and the output is calculated. This output is then compared to the actual output to determine the error.\n   - **Backpropagation**: The error is propagated backward through the network, and the weights of connections are adjusted using optimization algorithms like gradient descent. This iterative process helps the network minimize the error and improve its predictions.\n\n5. **Biases**: In addition to connection weights, neural networks also incorporate bias nodes in each layer. Bias nodes allow the network to capture constant offsets in the input data, enabling more flexibility in modeling complex relationships.\n\nBy incorporating details on activation functions, biases, and the training process, neural networks can effectively learn from data, recognize patterns, and make accurate predictions without the need for explicit programming.",
