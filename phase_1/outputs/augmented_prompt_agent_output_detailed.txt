PROMPT:
What are the key principles of object-oriented programming?

RESPONSE:
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects." Objects are instances of classes, which are templates for creating objects. The key principles of object-oriented programming are as follows:

1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, which is the class. This helps in hiding the internal state of an object and only allowing access to it through well-defined interfaces. For example, in a `Car` class, you can encapsulate the fuel level attribute and provide methods like `refuel()` and `drive()` to interact with it.

2. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is the ability of a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. This promotes code reusability and allows for creating a hierarchy of classes. For example, you can have a `Vehicle` class and then create subclasses like `Car` and `Motorcycle` that inherit from the `Vehicle` class.

3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This means that a method can behave differently based on the object it is called on. For example, you can have a `Shape` superclass with a `calculateArea()` method, and then have subclasses like `Circle` and `Rectangle` that implement their own versions of `calculateArea()`.

4. **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps in managing complexity by focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. For example, a `BankAccount` class might have methods like `deposit()` and `withdraw()` without exposing the internal workings of the account.

5. **Association**: Association represents the relationship between two or more objects. It can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. For example, a `Student` class can be associated with a `Course` class in a one-to-many relationship, where a student can enroll in multiple courses.

6. **Composition**: Composition is a strong form of association where one class contains another class as a part of its state. The contained class does not exist independently of the containing class. For example, a `Car` class may contain an `Engine` class as a part of its composition.

7. **Aggregation**: Aggregation is a weaker form of association where one class is associated with another class, but the associated class can exist independently. For example, a `Library` class can have an aggregation relationship with a `Book` class, where books can exist even if the library is closed.

By adhering to these key principles of object-oriented programming, developers can create more modular, flexible, and maintainable code that mimics real-world objects and relationships.
